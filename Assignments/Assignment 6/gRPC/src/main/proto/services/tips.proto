// This service saves tips that clients have added and keeps track of them. 
// A client can read all tips or add a new one. The server should maintain the state even after crashing.
// So you should save all the tips in a JSON or proto file (that is up to you). When starting the server the server should read the tips in. 
// You should make sure that the story cannot be changed by two people at the same time, so remember what you learned in the Threads lecture.
