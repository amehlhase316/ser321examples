##### Purpose
Each program has a short description as well as the Gradle file
* Please run `SockServer` and `SockClient` together.

SockServer initiates a simple socket server that awaits a String and Integer object from the client. The server will loop infinitely until the exit command is received, at which point it will drop the current client connection and await a new connection.
