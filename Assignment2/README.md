# Assignment 3 Overall Description and Video

>1. The intent of this project is to demonstrate and highlight the subtle differences between different network <br />
communication protocols.
> 2. While building this application, it also became necessary to run certain parts of <br />
the application asynchronously while locking certain resources in the event of a multithreaded environment. <br />
In the future, there will be a possibility for multiple players to participate in the same game but for now, <br />
only one player at a time. 
> 3. The TCP part of this project provides a lot of data security. In many ways, it is<br />
a much more robust network protocol. I noticed over my time developing this application that the network <br />
stability and reliability was far better with TCP rather than UDP. 
> 4. In terms of the application structure the two modules are very similar. The main differences fall <br />
along the lines of TCP having continuous connectivity vs UDP being a "Fire and Forget" protocol.
